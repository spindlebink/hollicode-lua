# Hollicode for Lua

A Hollicode bytecode interpreter written in Lua and still in construction. Moving alongside the language itself.

This interpreter is meant to serve as a reference implementation. It implements Hollicode's entire instruction set in a framework-agnostic and generally Lua-idiomatic way.

Included in this repository is a basic LÃ–VE-based visual runner for Hollicode scripts. It can be used as a jumping-off point for integrating the interpreter in your projects if you want.
